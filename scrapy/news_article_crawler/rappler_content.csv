"INFOGRAPHIC: What’s inside a multivitamin, and why do we need it?","Already have Rappler+?   to listen to groundbreaking journalism. SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. With the pandemic persisting for close to two years now, taking care of one’s health and immune system has become a major concern for most people. Getting vaccinated, wearing a mask, social distancing, and washing your hands are still the most effective ways to avoid getting any kind of infection. You can also take an extra step by also boosting your immune system. Our immune system is responsible for keeping tabs on foreign elements that may harm the body, and taking action when necessary. And there are a number of things you can do to keep it in top shape. This includes having a healthy diet, getting good hours of sleep, avoiding stress, and exercising regularly. You can also supplement these activities with multivitamins and minerals like Conzace to give your body and immune system an extra boost. But what exactly is in Conzace? We decided to take a closer look at the tablet to see what’s inside and why these components are important.
