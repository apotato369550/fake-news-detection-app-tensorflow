It’s clear the main target of this attack was energy infrastructure, but this is also an attempt by Moscow to strike at Ukraine’s reserves of another key resource: morale.

Ukrainians were electrified by the recent successful incursion of their troops deep into Russian territory in the Kursk region.

It’s been a year of bad news on the battlefield for Kyiv, with Russia gaining ground steadily in the eastern Donbas region. There have been problems with mobilisation and reports that Ukraine is running out of men.

But the videos of soldiers hoisting the Ukrainian flag over Russian villages they had seized gave a badly-needed boost to Ukrainian morale.

And it showed the West that Kyiv is still capable of carrying out complex, daring and – most importantly – successful offensives.

With today’s strikes, Russia is intending to bring ordinary people in Ukraine back down to earth with a bump – reminding them, and politicians in western capitals, that the Kremlin still has the upper hand in this war.

The message from Moscow: make no mistake, Russia can still inflict misery on the Ukrainian population whenever it chooses.","Ukrainians were electrified by the recent successful incursion of their troops deep into Russian territory in the Kursk region.

2,NHS 111 offers new mental health service,Unknown Author,"The new integrated service can give patients of all ages, including children, the chance to be listened to by a trained member of staff who can help direct them to the right place, says NHS director for mental health Claire Murdoch.

""So, if you or someone you know needs urgent mental health support, please call 111, and select the mental health option.""

Gemma Morris, who runs the Single Point Access team for the Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, says her team has worked very hard to get experienced staff.

""I think [the service] makes a lot of sense to people who've tried to get help and struggled.

""We do hear that quite a lot, that people went to this person, they went to their GP, maybe they didn't know how to ask for it, and they struggled.

""So the fact that they might just call 111, press 2, it makes it very simple.""

Her team is taking around 300-350 calls a day at the moment.

Some people are in a state of suicidal distress.

Most callers (around 90%) are adults but the helpline also has specialists from local children and adolescent mental health services.

Some callers are parents wanting advice and guidance.","The new integrated service can give patients of all ages, including children, the chance to be listened to by a trained member of staff who can help direct them to the right place, says NHS director for mental health Claire Murdoch.

4,Keir Starmer to say Parliament return is not 'business as usual',Unknown Author,"Sir Keir's address marks a week before Parliament returns from a shortened summer recess and is expected to ramp up attacks on the Conservatives' legacy.

The speech will echo some of the language used by Labour during and after the general election campaign.

Sir Keir will say ""the business of politics will resume, but it will not be business as usual"" and the government will ""get a grip"" on the problems faced in the UK.

The PM will warn that ""things will get worse"" in the UK before they get better as the Labour administration tries to deal with ""not just an economic black hole but a societal black hole"".

He will say: ""And that is why we have to take action and do things differently.

""Part of that is being honest with people - about the choices we face. And how tough this will be.

""Frankly - things will get worse before we get better.""

Sir Keir's speech will also suggest that the riots earlier this month showed ""the cracks in our society after 14 years of populism and failure"".

""The riots didn't just betray the sickness, they revealed the cure, found not in the cynical conflict of populism but in the coming together of a country the morning after"" to clear ""up their community"".","Sir Keir's address marks a week before Parliament returns from a shortened summer recess and is expected to ramp up attacks on the Conservatives' legacy.
